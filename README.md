# wget_go
I wanted to use wget on windows without having to download it. completely basic features.


`wget_go.exe -filename="choc.csv" -url="https://google.com/finance/historical?q=CHOC&output=csv"`

* if you want to, you can set the windows environment variables and point to the directory. 
* if you want it on Linux, go build -o wget_go.go
