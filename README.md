# wget_go
I wanted to use wget on windows without having to download it. completely basic features.


`wget_go.exe -filename="~\Downloads\output.csv" -url="https://some_url...csv"`

if you want to, you can set the windows environment variables and point to the directory. 
if you want it on Linux, go build -o wget_go.go
